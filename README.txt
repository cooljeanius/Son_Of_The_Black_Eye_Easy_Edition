I know this is supposed to be an expert-level campaign, but I still wanted to
beat it anyways, so I had to edit it a lot. I edited it so much that I'm
making this repository so that I can publish my changes as a separate campaign
on the add-on server. Here's a description of my changes so far:

01 End of Peace: Just some basic gold tweaks. Probably too easy now, but it's
  the first scenario, so it ought to be easy IMO.
02 The Human Army: Just gold tweaks
03 Toward Mountains of Haag: Just basic gold/turns tweaks again
04 The Siege of Barag Gor: OK now here's where things really start to change.
  The defenders of Barag Gor kept dying before I could save them, so I had to
  make them stronger. The shamans wouldn't hit anything whenever they attacked,
  so I made their attacks magic, partly to increase their hit chances, and
  partly also because that just made more sense to me anyways? Also I put more
  villages inside of Barag Gor for healing, and also because as a city, it just
  made sense to have them. I also made Rugh's death cause defeat, which may
  seem like it makes it harder, but actually it makes it easier by saving you
  the time of just waiting around after he dies for the rest of you to die as
  well, because that's basically what happens when he dies anyways. To make up
  for his death now causing defeat, I upgraded him into a Nightblade on Easy.
  I also added some traits to the shamans. While putting "Aged" on the Old one
  might make things harder, it just made more sense flavor-wise. And the traits
  I put on the other two were positive. I also gave the defenders of Barag Gor
  2 more archers on Easy.
05 To the Harbor of Tirigaz: apologize for Holy Water being a red herring
06 Black Flag: Here the enemies kept overtaking me before I really had a chance
  to set up, so I removed their starting villages so they'd waste more time
  capturing them instead. I also wanted to give your ally some villages as
  well, so I made Affman a leader so that his side could have villages.
  Finally, I also turned the generals into lieutenants in this scenario as
  well.
07 The Desert of Death: It took too long waiting for everyone to get a chance
  to recover from their scorpion poisonings, so I added more villages to the
  map.
08 Silent Forest: basic gold/turns tweaks; use LIMIT_CONTEMPORANEOUS_RECRUITS
  more; get gold on interrogation
09 Shan Taum the Smug: just gold tweaks; make Shan Taum's side persistent
10 Saving Inarix: I made it much easier to save Inarix here. I turned Thelarion
  from an Elvish Champion into an Elvish Hero here, and since he keeps coming
  back in later missions, I made (or at least tried to make) his side
  persistent (as well as Darstang's). I upgraded Plonk from a Slayer to a
  Nightblade to help you break thru the bottleneck on the bridge more easily.
  I gave Inarix more guards escorting him on easy, and adjusted their
  coordinates.
11 Clash of Armies: I reduced the number of gryphons the dwarves recruit here
  so you don't have to split your attention as much and can focus more easily.
  I also reduced the HP boosts for the transport ships so they can be destroyed
  more easily.
12 Giving Some Back: basic gold/turns tweaks; also gave orcs starting villages
13 The Dwarvish Stand: Started off as just gold tweaks, also decided to give
  the player a yeti here as it's the first of a series of winter levels.
14 Back Home: I used the LIMIT_CONTEMPORANEOUS_RECRUITS and ON_DIFFICULTY
  macros here a lot.
15 Civil War: mostly just some basic turns/gold tweaks. I might go back and
  add back the commented-out assassination code later, but I'll need to find
  a way to give the player a way to sneak around the front lines to actually
  pull off assassinations while the enemy still has other units alive...
16 The Coward: I edited the map here to give the player more keep tiles for
  recruiting, so they can catch up to the stream on enemies flooding them on
  time. Also some gold levels tweaks. In retrospect after the enemy's initial
  assault wears off they're not left with much, so I might want to give them
  an income to make up for the reduction in gold I docked them with.
17 The Human Attack: just gold tweaks.
18 Northern Alliance: again, mostly just gold tweaks. I also tried to make
  Shan Taum more defensive so he'd defend more against Howgarth rather than
  killing your green side of orcish allies, but that didn't really work. I
  mean, it worked in the sense that I saved my allies after I made my edits,
  but Howgarth still got to Shan Taum before me though.
